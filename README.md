üåü **Welcome to our Image Classification with Streamlit Project!** üñºÔ∏èüîç

In this repository, we explore the fascinating world of image classification using Streamlit, a simple yet powerful tool for building data apps with Python. With Streamlit, we can create an interactive web application that allows users to upload images and instantly classify them using machine learning models.

### What You'll Find:

1. **Getting Started:** Learn how to set up your environment, install dependencies, and run the Streamlit app locally.
   
2. **Upload and Classify Images:** Experience the magic of image classification firsthand by uploading your own images and seeing them categorized by our trained model.
   
3. **Fine-Tuning and Evaluation:** Dive deeper into model fine-tuning techniques and evaluate the performance of different models on various datasets.
   
4. **Deployment:** Discover how to deploy your image classification app to the web, making it accessible to users worldwide.
